          Today, whether we sit surrounded by friends or enjoy a better place in
          life after surviving our worst phases, we must remember the ones who
          stood by us. There is always someone who sacrificed their time,
          effort, and peace just to see us reach where we are today. Such people
          never hesitated to help, never asked for anything in return—only
          wished for our happiness and success. Let us never forget them, never
          repay them with hurt, but instead honor their efforts with the same
          care and loyalty.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2 class="section-title">1. My Regret</h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            My greatest regret is that during your worst phase, I gave
            everything I had—my time, my energy, my peace—just to see you in a
            better place, but in return I was left unvalued. I regret that even
            though I stood with you in every storm, when it was my turn to lean
            on you, you were not there for me. I regret ignoring my own needs
            and pain, believing that my sacrifices would one day be recognized,
            but instead, they were overlooked.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2 class="section-title">2. What I Did for You</h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            During your darkest moments, I dedicated myself to lifting you up. I
            put in every ounce of effort to make your life better, to remind you
            that brighter days would come. I never hesitated to reply to your
            messages, even when I was busy or exhausted. I stayed available
            whenever you needed me, no matter how inconvenient it was for me.
            <br /><br />
            I constantly tried to motivate you when you were on the verge of
            giving up, repeating again and again that things would eventually
            get better. I fought for you as if your battles were my own,
            standing like a shield when you were about to fall apart. Even when
            you doubted yourself, I assured you that following my advice would
            help you push through.
            <br /><br />
            There were many times when you ended our friendship with harsh
            behavior, yet I was always the one who tried to convince you to come
            back. And when you did return, often with an emotional tone, I
            accepted you again and started everything from the beginning—despite
            the fact that most of the mistakes were yours.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2 class="section-title">3. How I Felt Hurt</h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            What hurt me most was not just the mistakes, but the way you never
            stood by me when I truly needed you. I ignored the pain you gave me,
            hoping one day you would see how much I cared, but that day never
            came. For five years, I overlooked your mistakes and endured your
            emotional swings, sacrificing my own mental peace just to keep the
            bond alive.
            <br /><br />
            It broke me to see that you had time for traveling, for spending
            moments with others, and for everything else in your life—but you
            didn't have time for me, the one who stood by you during your lowest
            phases. I gave you unconditional support, yet I was left without the
            same care in return. Despite contributing to the person you are
            today and the happiness you now enjoy, my role was ignored, and I
            was left feeling unseen and unappreciated.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2 class="section-title">4. What This Means to Me</h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            This entire experience has left me questioning the meaning of
            loyalty and sacrifice. I don't understand why caring for someone so
            deeply only brought me pain and emptiness. It feels unfair that my
            devotion, my sleepless nights, my endless patience, and my
            sacrifices were never acknowledged. I am left wondering if helping
            someone and caring at such a level is even worth it, when all it
            seems to bring back is silence and regret.

        <div class="section closing-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">5. Closing Reflection</h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            Still, the truth remains: I was there. I stood by you in your worst
            phases, I gave you my time, my strength, and my love when you were
            about to give up. That will always remain a part of me, no matter
            what. Yet the wound of being unseen and unvalued cuts deep.
            <br /><br />
            From this, I have learned a painful but important truth: giving
            everything to someone does not mean they will give the same in
            return. But it does reveal my own strength—my loyalty, my honesty,
            and my ability to care beyond limits. And even if I was left hurt, I
            know I loved and cared with all my heart, and that is something I
            will never regret about myself.
